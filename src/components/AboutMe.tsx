        <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl">
          As a self-learned creative and passionate programmer/developer, I like
          to build and develop software for any platform. Learning, improving
          skills, solving problems, and adapting to new technologies are my
          hobbies. I can give my total effort and perform teamwork with
          responsibility.
